# LineOS
A wiki for my Scratch OS called Line!

Line was made for one simple reason: _To further my understanding of the fundementals of computers by building my own._
Line is also my entrance point to using Github, it may seem like a silly thing to use Github for a Scratch project of all things, but when you think about it as a test/practice, it makes a little bit more sense.
My eyes hurt.

**"Barbeque sauce."**

If you ever get confused about the mentioning of "barbeque sauce", dont worry, its just another way for me to say "Nonsense" or "spagetthi code" or maybe even "rubbish". Just something that doesnt exist at all or is poorly put together.

This is a personal project made by Min Fou, started in January of 2026.
The goal of the Line project is explained by this quote: "If you don't know how a boat floats, build a boat. Then you will know how a boat floats.", meaning that since I dont know how an OS works, I will go headfirst into building my own, even if it is in the most simple programming language that exists.

I am very proud of my work here, and I am not really sure how to show it off, so I guess if you are reading this, you are one in a million!
