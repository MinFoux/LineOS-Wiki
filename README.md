A wiki for my Scratch OS called Line!

Line was made for one simple reason: _To further my understanding of the fundementals of computers by building my own._
Line is also my entrance point to using Github, it may seem like a silly thing to use Github for a Scratch project of all things, but when you think about it as a test/practice, it makes a little bit more sense.
My eyes hurt.

**Barbeque sauce.**
