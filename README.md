# LineOS
A wiki for my Scratch OS called Line!

Line was made for one simple reason: _To further my understanding of the fundementals of computers by building my own._
Line is also my entrance point to using Github, it may seem like a silly thing to use Github for a Scratch project of all things, but when you think about it as a test/practice, it makes a little bit more sense.
My eyes hurt.

**"Barbeque sauce."**

If you ever get confused about the mentioning of "barbeque sauce", dont worry, its just another way for me to say "Nonsense" or "spagetthi code" or maybe even "rubbish". Just something that doesnt exist at all or is poorly put together.
